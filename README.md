# hello-world
Hi guys! New in the community hoping to learn a lot!
Based in Italy right now, in my hometown, I have been living in Australia for about six years, where I studied digital design.
I moved back to Italy few years ago and then tried the Netherlands, where I began to self-study web-developing.
My goal is to implement web dev skills to the graphic design field, expanding my knowledge and be a better candidate on the job market.
